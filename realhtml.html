<img src="thadingyut_1.jpg" alt="firstpicture" style="width: 50%; padding-left: 320px; height: 250px">
<p>During Thadingyut, pagodas and homes through the country are decorated with electric lights, colorful paper 
lanterns, candles and even small ceramic saucers filled with oill in which wicis are lit. Major religious sites 
such as Shwedagon Pagoda are packed with pilgrims who light candles to pay homage to the Buddha and 
gain merit. Each light adds to the incredible spectacle of thousands of small flames burning in the night. Out 
on the streets, meanwhile, some people light fireworks or launch small hot-air balloons, which silently 
ascend and drift across the sky before burning out.</p><br><br>
